 Friday - A Python-based personal assistant that uses speech recognition and text-to-speech technology to interact with users. This assistant can perform a variety of tasks including searching Wikipedia, opening websites, telling the time, and playing music. It also has the ability to send emails using Gmail. The project was built using Python 3 and various libraries such as Pyttsx3, SpeechRecognition, and Wikipedia. This project has potential for expansion and customization, and can serve as a great starting point for anyone interested in building their own personal assistant.
